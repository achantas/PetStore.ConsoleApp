# PetStore.ConsoleApp

I. To see the console output, make sure PetStore.ConsoleApp is set as startup project and run the app.

II. Extend the PetService to include further operations for Pets when necessary in future.

III. Create new services to access pet store orders and for operations about user respectively to take the solution to next level.

IV. Convert the console app to a class library and consume it in a newly created MVC project with UI to make this application to fit for the enterprise.


ChatGPT transscript as follows when used the command to Optimize code in Program.cs:


    The code provided seems to be working fine.However, there are a few optimizations that can be made to improve the code:

    1. Use the `await` keyword instead of `GetAwaiter().GetResult()` to asynchronously wait for the result of the `GetAllAvailablePets` method.

    ```csharp
    var allAvailablePets = await GetAllAvailablePets(client);
    ```

    2. Use the `using` statement for the `HttpClient` to ensure proper disposal of resources.

    ```csharp
    using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())
    {
        // code here
    }
    ```

    3. Use `ConfigureAwait(false)` when awaiting the `GetAsync` method to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary context switching.

    ```csharp
    HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync(availablePetsPath).ConfigureAwait(false);
    ```

    4. Use `ConfigureAwait(false)` when awaiting the `ReadAsAsync` method to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary context switching.

    ```csharp
    pets = await response.Content.ReadAsAsync<IEnumerable<Pet>>().ConfigureAwait(false);
    ```

    5. Use `async` modifier for the `Main` method to allow asynchronous operations.

    ```csharp
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    ```

    By implementing these optimizations, the code will be more efficient and maintainable.
